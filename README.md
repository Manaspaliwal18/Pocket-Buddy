PocketBuddy: The Guilt-Free Spending Tracker üòé

The Problem :
Many students struggle to manage their daily spending because they know their monthly budget but have no clear idea of how much they can safely spend each day after paying fixed expenses. This often leads to overspending and stress.

The Solution :
This project, PocketBuddy, is a simple Python tool that solves this problem. By taking your monthly income and fixed expenses, it automatically calculates your daily "guilt-free" spending allowance. The tool also provides instant feedback on your daily spending and visualizes where your money is going, making budgeting simple and actionable.

How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
The application takes your monthly income and fixed expenses to calculate your daily spending limit. As you add your daily expenses, the tool keeps a running tally. It will give you a friendly warning if you are spending too much for the day and show you a chart to visualize your spending habits by category. This ensures you can stay on track without complicated apps.

What I Learned üë®‚Äçüíª
This project was a great way for me to practice and learn some essential skills:

Project Structure: How to organize a small Python project for readability and scalability.

Data Handling: I used Pandas to read and manage CSV data.

Time & Logic: I used the datetime module to calculate remaining days in the month.

Clean Code: Writing clean, readable code with functions and docstrings.

Portfolio Ready: I learned how to prepare a project for GitHub to create a professional portfolio.

Feel free to check out the code and see how it works!
