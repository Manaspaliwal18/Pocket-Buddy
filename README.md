Problem
Many students struggle to manage daily spending because they know their monthly budget but have no clear idea of how much they can safely spend each day after paying fixed expenses like rent, groceries, or subscriptions. This often leads to overspending, stress, and difficulty saving.

Solution
This project is a Python command-line tool that calculates a student’s daily “guilt-free” spending allowance. By taking the monthly income and fixed expenses as input, it automatically computes how much can be spent each day for the rest of the month. The tool also warns if expenses exceed income and ensures simple, actionable budgeting without complicated apps.
